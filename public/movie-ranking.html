<h1>The Best Movies According to Me! AKA Personal Faves</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Sore: Istri dari masa depan</h3>
<p>This is one of if not my favorite movies, from it's cinematic and also the story is very unique and refreshing, it
    gives people hope that marriage isn't always a bad thing, and if you truly love someone, will you try to go over and
    over again, dying just to save the one you love the most?</p>
<h3>When Life Gives you Tangerine</h3>
<p>It made me cry a lot and made me think alot of stuff. It's very beautiful, sad, romantic at the same time. It makes
    me love people who are close to me, especially my family. It teaches me alot about the importance of Family.

<h3>Kimi no Nawa</h3>
<p>Actually, the plot is very simillar to Sore, but this one is the original one i think? but it's definetly not as sad
    because both didn't have to go what Sore and Jo did, whereas Sore have to repeat the cycle for maybe millions or
    thousand times dying just to save Jo, but Kimi No Nawa has always given be a good impression and if not one of the
    best movie I've ever seen.</p>
